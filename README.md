## Project Description

It's time to put your stock picking skills to the test. The question is, who has a better 
eye for stocks - you or your brother? The game is a simulation of the stock market, lasting 
for a total of 5 trading days. Each player will start with a balance of $10,000 and have the
opportunity to choose from a selection of 10 different stocks. The objective of the game is
to make strategic buy, sell, or hold decisions to increase your account balance and become
the ultimate winner. Throughout the game, you will be able to access a news feed room to stay
updated on current events, a trading room where you can make your transactions, and advance to
the next round to start a new trading day. The ultimate winner will be determined on day 4 and
will be the player with the highest account balance. So, may the HOLD be with you, and let the
stock market games begin!
